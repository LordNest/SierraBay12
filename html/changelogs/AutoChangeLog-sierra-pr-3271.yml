changes:
  - {tweak: Filth overlays like blood and oil now tracks a transferral value for each
      item. Items with filth transferral will transfer their blood/oil to whatever
      they interact with.}
  - {tweak: interacting with items with bloody hands or gloves will transfer that
      blood/oil to the item depending on how filthy you are.}
  - {tweak: Squashed some legacy values related to blood overlays for items like shoes
      and items in general}
  - {tweak: Forensic DNA from blood will now transfer to items when interacting with
      them with bloody hands/gloves}
  - {tweak: Hugging people or grabbing them while covered in blood/oil will transfer
      it.}
  - {bugfix: Fixed coat and armor layered filth overlays using incorrect icon states}
